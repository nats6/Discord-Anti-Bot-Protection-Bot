## Introduction
This automation tool prevents malicious bot accounts from invading Discord servers by automatically identifying suspicious behavior patterns and enforcing customizable verification systems.

### Securing Your Discord Community
- Detects mass-join raids and suspicious bot-like activities in real time.  
- Implements CAPTCHA and reaction verification to confirm real users.  
- Tracks unusual message patterns to stop spam or fake engagement.  
- Keeps your Discord server secure 24/7 with adaptive rule-based protection.  
- Reduces the need for manual moderation and admin oversight.

## How It Works
1. **Input or Trigger** — The system continuously monitors join events, message activity, and profile creation times through the Appilot dashboard.  
2. **Core Logic** — Behavior analysis algorithms identify abnormal message rates, mass joins, or cloned usernames, and apply configured rules.  
3. **Output or Action** — Suspicious users are muted, kicked, or prompted with verification tasks automatically.  
4. **Other Functionalities** — Detailed logs, error recovery, and customizable ban durations ensure reliability and control.

## Tech Stack
**Language:** Python, JavaScript  
**Frameworks:** Discord.py, Discord.js, TensorFlow Lite (for ML), FastAPI  
**Tools:** Appilot, Node.js, Docker, Redis, Webhooks, Discord Developer API  
**Infrastructure:** Scalable Discord server clusters, containerized services, logging pipelines, webhook alert system.
